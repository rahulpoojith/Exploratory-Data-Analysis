# Exploratory-Data-Analysis


Project Lifecycle for Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) of Airline Performance

Step 1: Problem Statement

Understand the challenges faced by airlines in enhancing performance and improving customer satisfaction.
Identify key metrics and factors that contribute to airline performance, such as on-time performance, flight cancellations, customer satisfaction, and revenue.
Step 2: Data Collection and Preparation

Gather data from various sources, such as the Bureau of Transportation Statistics (BTS), the International Air Transport Association (IATA), and airline company websites.
Clean, preprocess, and harmonize the data to ensure consistency and reliability.
Identify and handle missing values, outliers, and potential biases.
Step 3: Exploratory Data Analysis

Univariate Analysis:

Analyze distributions of key metrics using histograms, scatterplots, and boxplots.
Identify patterns, trends, and potential anomalies in the data.
Calculate summary statistics (e.g., mean, median, standard deviation) to understand central tendency and variability.
Multivariate Analysis:

Explore relationships between different variables using correlation matrices and scatterplots.
Identify potential dependencies, correlations, and causal factors that influence airline performance.
Use techniques such as principal component analysis (PCA) to reduce data dimensionality and identify latent patterns.
Clustering and Segmentation:

Group airlines based on similar performance profiles using clustering algorithms.
Identify distinct segments of airlines and analyze their characteristics and performance trends.
Visualization and Storytelling:

Create interactive data visualizations using libraries like Seaborn, Plotly, and Tableau.
Present the findings in a clear and compelling manner, highlighting insights and potential areas for improvement.
Step 4: Interpretation and Insights

Draw actionable conclusions from the EDA.
Identify factors that contribute to airline performance and areas for improvement.
Propose data-driven recommendations to enhance on-time performance, reduce cancellations, and improve customer satisfaction.
Step 5: Reporting and Communication

Prepare comprehensive reports and presentations to communicate the findings to stakeholders.
Host meetings or webinars to discuss insights and implications for airline strategy and operations.
Make recommendations based on the analysis and provide guidance for future data collection and analysis initiatives.
Specific Focus on EDA in the Airlines Industry

On-time performance: Analyze factors contributing to flight delays and cancellations, such as weather, maintenance issues, and crew shortages.
Customer satisfaction: Explore correlations between performance metrics and customer ratings, identifying pain points and areas for improvement.
Revenue optimization: Understand the impact of factors such as flight load, pricing, and ancillary services on airline revenue.
Resource allocation: Identify areas where airlines can optimize resource allocation to improve efficiency and reduce costs.
Competitive analysis: Compare performance metrics and strategies of different airlines to identify strengths, weaknesses, and opportunities for differentiation.
